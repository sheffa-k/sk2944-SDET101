# Personal Portfolio Website & Final Project: HealthTrack

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my background, skills, and projects as a student of **Medical Informatics Technology**. This portfolio also includes my final project, **HealthTrack** — a personal health activity tracker built as part of the **SDET 101** course at **NJIT**. The website is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** with responsive design, and the final project leverages **Flask**, **SQLite**, and **Chart.js**.
